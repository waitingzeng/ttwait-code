What can Ads Minded actually offer ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * 1. High CTR AdSense layout
      Ads Minded uses a high CTR AdSense layout created by me which I named it QuickSenseTM (sounds similar to quicksand).
      I can’t disclose the CTR here as doing so is violating AdSense TOS, but I can tell you QuickSenseTM has the highest CTR for all my advertisement placements. :) 

    * 2. Search Engine Friendly
      Ads Minded was built with search engine in mind. I place the content column of the left side and the 2 sidebars on the right so that search engines read the blog content first before crawling the not-so-important items on the sidebar.

    * 3. Advertisement Sequence
      The sequence you place the advertisements is important because the first advertisement code usually carries highest paying advertisement. Hence, due to the high CTR of QuickSenseTM, I place it on top of all codes in order to get high paying advertisements.

    * 4. Better Ads Targeting
      Advertisements can be shifted around in the blog for better targeting just by shifting the advertisement codes. Each column can at least contain one type of advertisement format. They are designed to nicely fit different type of advertisements.
