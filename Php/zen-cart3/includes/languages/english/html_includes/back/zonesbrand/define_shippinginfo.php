        <p><strong>Drop shipping is simply an arrangement between you   and the manufacturer or distributor of a product you wish to sell in which the   manufacturer or distributor--not you--ships the product to your customers. This   means you can sell quality, brand-name products on your Web site for a hefty   profit, while someone else looks after product development and order   fulfillment.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>How Drop   Shipping Works<br />
      </strong>Let's say Mary sets up a Web site   where she sells a product called &quot;The Total Skin Care Package,&quot; priced at $97. A   customer visits her site, places an order, and is billed $97 plus $11 for   shipping and handling. </p>
      <p>Mary then sends her distributor an e-mail with her   customer's order and shipping information. The manufacturer packs up the   customer's order, puts Mary's shipping label on the package, and mails it out   via UPS or FedEx or EMS or DHL, usually with in few days.</p>
      <p>The distributor then bills Mary for the wholesale price of   the &quot;Total Skin Care Package&quot;--in this case, $64 plus $11 for shipping and   handling. Since Mary has passed the shipping and handling fee on to her   customer, she just netted a profit of $33. And all she had to do was send her   manufacturer an e-mail! </p>
      <p><strong>Drop Shipping   Advantages<br />
      </strong>In addition to not having to worry   about shipping products yourself, there are a few other advantages to this   business model. First, it saves you the cost of building your own inventory. If   you're like most people starting a small business, you   don't have a ton of extra money lying around--the last thing you want to do is   tie up your cash in inventory that you may or may not be able to sell. </p>
      <p>Second, no inventory also means no leftovers. If the   product you sell suddenly becomes outdated, obsolete or just plain untrendy, you   aren't the one with a room or warehouse full of stock nobody will buy. Many   online retailers find themselves having to offer deep discounts--and taking huge   losses--on old products just to get them out of their homes or warehouses to   make room for more inventory. </p>
      <p>Third, you'll be able to add new products to your site   almost instantly. Since you don't have to worry about stocking inventory, if you   find that your customers are clamoring for a particular product, it's not   unrealistic to expect you could add the item to your site in just a few days. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Final Thoughts<br />
      </strong>Drop shipping can be   an easy way to get started selling online. Since the manufacturer or distributor   takes care of warehousing and shipping, you'll be able to concentrate your   efforts on building your site and marketing your products. And this is what most   entrepreneurs are good at. </p>
      <p align="left">When searching for a product to drop ship, don't   spend money on &quot;drop shipping directories.&quot; Think about it: Not only is their   information frequently out of date, but everyone who buys these lists will be   contacting the same companies, which means more competition for the products   you'll be selling. </p>
      <p align="left">And choose your products carefully: </p>
      <p align="left">1. Make sure there aren't already hundreds of   sites selling the same thing at prices you can't afford to compete with. </p>
      <p align="left">2. Choose products that target a &quot;niche&quot; market   rather than &quot;everyone.&quot; You'll always be more successful with this strategy. </p>
      <p align="left">3. Ask yourself: Is this a product I would buy  myself?</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Most important, remember that drop   shipping isn't a magic formula that will make you rich. Building a business   always takes a certain amount of elbow grease. The real &quot;magic&quot; is that drop   shipping allows you to invest your money in marketing rather than   inventory, and a well-planned marketing strategy is what will ultimately help   you build a lucrative online income.</strong></p>
